### The Flutter Vignettes

This vignette is part of a collection of explorations into the exciting user experience possibilities enabled by the Flutter platform. Built by [gskinner](https://gskinner.com) in partnership with Google, these vignettes range from practical to novel. They aim to inspire both developers and designers to build delightful and beautiful experiences with Flutter. You can view all of the vignettes in the main [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter_vignettes). 

In addition to reviewing and forking the [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md) code available here, you can also check out more information on the [Vignette Showcase Website](https://flutter.gskinner.com).

### Installation

If you're new to Flutter the first thing you'll need is to follow the [setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Once you're set up and can compile the sample Flutter app, you're ready to run some vignettes!

Each vignette is stored in its own folder in the repository. Using your IDE of choice, open the vignette directory you'd like to run. Then, using the terminal inside youre IDE, run `flutter get` to fetch any dependencies, and `flutter run` to deploy to your connected device or simulator.

If you would like to try these for Flutter for web, you can use `flutter run -d chrome`. Note that Flutter for web is currently a technical preview and not all of the vignettes will work correctly. For more information on enabling Flutter for web follow the [setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web).

### License

These vignettes are released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md). You can use the code for any purpose, including commercial projects.
